    <p><em>Norwalk Havoc Robot League is where our whole year of work pays off.</em>
      After hours of tinkering with and optimizing the robots, we will take
      our team and our 12 pound robots to Norwalk,
      CT to face off against opponents all around CT and the tri-state area.
      Due to COVID getting in the way of our 2020 and 2021 competitions, this
      year will be our first time going to competition in March 2022, and <em>we
      can't wait.</em>

    <p>In future years, our goal is to build a 30 lb robot to send to the
      University of Illinois Urbana Champaign's Robobrawl competition.
