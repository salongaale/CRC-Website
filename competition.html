      <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

      <p><em>Norwalk Havoc Robot League is where our whole year of work pays off.</em>
        After hours of tinkering with and optimizing the robots, we will take
        our team and our 12 pound robots to Norwalk,
        CT to face off against opponents all around CT and the tri-state area.
        Due to COVID getting in the way of our 2020 and 2021 competitions, this
        year will be our first time going to competition in March 2022, and <em>we
        can't wait.</em>
      </p>

    </div>
    <p>In future years, our goal is to build a 30 lb robot to send to the
      University of Illinois Urbana Champaign's Robobrawl competition.
