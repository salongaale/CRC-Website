        <h1 class="rounded-red-bg-title">Design Reviews</h1>
        <p>Our design process at CRC is driven by extensive planning,
          careful documentation, and constant feedback. We hold at least
          two Design Review events every semester where each subteam's progress is presented to the full team,
          friends of the team, and guest professors alongside a Q&A session to
          robustify our work. Whether it becomes a session of praise or a smackdown, we wouldn't be able
          to produce our our robots at this level of quality without putting the
          designs through our careful and engaging review process! Attending our design reviews is also
          a great way to see CRC in action.

        <h1 class="rounded-red-bg-title">Norwalk Havok Robot League</h1>
        <p><em>Norwalk Havoc Robot League is where our whole year of work pays off.</em>
          After hours of tinkering with and optimizing the robots, we will take
          our team and our 12 pound robots to Norwalk,
          CT to face off against opponents all around CT and the tri-state area.
          Due to COVID getting in the way of our 2020 and 2021 competitions, this
          year will be our first time going to competition in March 2022, and <em>we
          can't wait.</em> <br> More info about the competition can be found <a href="https://50day.io/mediawiki/index.php/Norwalk_Havoc_Robot_League">here.</a>
