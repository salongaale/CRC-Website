        Welcome to Combat Robotics at Cornell, a third-year robotics team at Cornell University.
        â€‹
        We believe that working in a competitive, supportive environment on a robotics team can help students grow as
        both engineers and leaders of the future. Our hope is to provide an outlet for excited students to engage with
        hands-on experience in mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering.

      <h2>
        Our Story
      </h2>
      <p>Founded in Fall 2019, our team aimed to create a fun and inclusive
        environment where our members can learn about the exciting field of combat
        robotics, enhance their skills in the domain(s) of their interest, and make
        long lasting friendships. As a start-up team, we had humble beginnings and
        built the foundation we have today with minimal resources, passionate members,
        and a ton of trial and error until we found processes that work best for us.
        Today, we are 25 members strong and are excited to welcome a new class of
        members this fall.</p>
