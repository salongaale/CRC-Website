          Welcome to Combat Robotics at Cornell, a third-year robotics team at
          Cornell University. </p> <p>
          We believe that working in a competitive, supportive environment on a
          robotics team can help students grow as
          both engineers and leaders of the future. Our hope is to provide an
          outlet for excited students to engage with
          hands-on experience in mechanical, electrical, and computer
          engineering.

      <h2>
        Our Story
      </h2>
      <p>Founded in Fall 2019, our team aimed to create a fun and inclusive
        environment where our members can learn about the exciting field of
        combat
        robotics, enhance their skills in the domain(s) of their interest, and
        make
        long lasting friendships. As a start-up team, we had humble beginnings
        and
        built the foundation we have today with minimal resources, passionate
        members,
        and a ton of trial and error until we found processes that work best for
        us.
        Today, we are 25 members strong and are excited to welcome a new class
        of
        members this fall.</p>
