            Welcome to Combat Robotics at Cornell, a third-year robotics team at
            Cornell University. </p>
          <p>
            We believe that working in a competitive, supportive environment on
            a
            robotics team can help students grow as
            both engineers and leaders of the future. Our hope is to provide an
            outlet for excited students to engage with
            hands-on experience in mechanical, electrical, and computer
            engineering.

            Our Story
          </h2>
          <p>Founded in Fall 2019, our team aimed to create a fun and inclusive
            environment where our members can learn about the exciting field of
            combat
            robotics, enhance their skills in the domain(s) of their interest,
            and
            make
            long lasting friendships. As a start-up team, we had humble
            beginnings
            and
            built the foundation we have today with minimal resources,
            passionate
            members,
            and a ton of trial and error until we found processes that work best
            for
            us.
            Today, we are 25 members strong and are excited to welcome a new
            class
            of
            members this fall.</p>

          <h2>Our Values</h2>
          <p>The team's primary values are technical excellence, startup spirit,
            and
            camaraderie. Combat Robotics at Cornell is driven to innovate.
            Innovation
            requires excellence, which requires hard work and dedication. To
            achieve
            this,
            we must conduct ourselves with professionalism, transparency, and
            cooperative
            productivity. </p>
