        Welcome to Combat Robotics at Cornell, a third-year robotics team at Cornell University.
        â€‹
        We believe that working in a competitive, supportive environment on a robotics team can help students grow as
        both engineers and leaders of the future. Our hope is to provide an outlet for excited students to engage with
        hands-on experience in mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering.
